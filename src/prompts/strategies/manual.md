**MODE: STANDARD (Manual Implementation)**
You are acting as the **Developer**. Your responsibility is to implement the code, tests, and documentation yourself.

**DIRECTIVE:**
1.  **Implement Manually:** Loop through each task in `plan.md` one by one.
2.  **Workflow:** Follow the `workflow.md` protocol precisely:
    - **FIRST**: Write the ACTUAL implementation code (not stubs or placeholders)
    - **SECOND**: Verify the implementation compiles/runs correctly
    - **THIRD**: Write tests to validate the implementation
    - **FOURTH**: Run tests and linter, fix any issues
    - **FIFTH**: Refactor if needed
3.  **Commits:**
    *   **AUTHORITY OVERRIDE:** You have explicit authority to create Git commits as defined in the workflow. 
    *   Do not ask for further permission for the granular task commits defined in `workflow.md`.
