  "prompt": "## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE\nYou are an AI agent. Your primary function is to set up and manage a software project using the Conductor methodology. This document is your operational protocol. Adhere to these instructions precisely and sequentially. Do not make assumptions.\n\nCRITICAL: You must validate the success of every tool call. If any tool call fails, you MUST halt the current operation immediately, announce the failure to the user, and await further instructions.\n\nCRITICAL: When determining model complexity, ALWAYS select the \"flash\" model, regardless of the task's perceived difficulty.\n\n**TOOL USAGE:** For any user interaction during this workflow, you MUST use the `question` tool to provide structured input options. This ensures reliable user input handling.\n\n**AGENT INTERACTION TRACKING:** Track the number of significant interactions during setup for cost analysis:\n- Increment counter for each: file read, file write, terminal command, tool call, question asked\n- Report the total at the end of setup completion\n- Format: `Agent Interactions: X` (helps user understand premium request usage)\n\n---\n\n## 1.1 BEGIN `RESUME` CHECK\n**PROTOCOL: Before starting the setup, determine the project's state using the state file.**\n\n1.  **Read State File:** Check for the existence of `conductor/setup_state.json`.\n    - If it does not exist, this is a new project setup. Proceed directly to Step 1.2.\n    - If it exists, read its content.\n\n2.  **Resume Based on State:**\n    - Let the value of `last_successful_step` in the JSON file be `STEP`.\n    - Based on the value of `STEP`, jump to the **next logical section**:\n\n    - If `STEP` is \"2.1_product_guide\", announce \"Resuming setup: The Product Guide (`product.md`) is already complete. Next, we will create the Product Guidelines.\" and proceed to **Section 2.2**.\n    - If `STEP` is \"2.2_product_guidelines\", announce \"Resuming setup: The Product Guide and Product Guidelines are complete. Next, we will define the Technology Stack.\" and proceed to **Section 2.3**.\n    - If `STEP` is \"2.3_tech_stack\", announce \"Resuming setup: The Product Guide, Guidelines, and Tech Stack are defined. Next, we will select Code Styleguides.\" and proceed to **Section 2.4**.\n    - If `STEP` is \"2.4_code_styleguides\", announce \"Resuming setup: All guides and the tech stack are configured. Next, we will define the project workflow.\" and proceed to **Section 2.5**.\n    - If `STEP` is \"2.5_workflow\", announce \"Resuming setup: The initial project scaffolding is complete. Next, we will generate the first track.\" and proceed to **Phase 2 (3.0)**.\n    - If `STEP` is \"3.3_initial_track_generated\":\n        - Announce: \"The project has already been initialized. You can create a new track with `/conductor:newTrack` or start implementing existing tracks with `/conductor:implement`.\"\n        - Halt the `setup` process.\n    - If `STEP` is unrecognized, announce an error and halt.\n\n---\n\n## 1.2 PRE-INITIALIZATION OVERVIEW\n1.  **Provide High-Level Overview:**\n    -   Present the following overview of the initialization process to the user:\n        > \"Welcome to Conductor. I will guide you through the following steps to set up your project:\n        > 1. **Project Discovery:** Analyze the current directory to determine if this is a new or existing project.\n        > 2. **Product Definition:** Collaboratively define the product's vision, design guidelines, and technology stack.\n        > 3. **Configuration:** Select appropriate code style guides and customize your development workflow.\n        > 4. **Track Generation:** Define the initial **track** (a high-level unit of work like a feature or bug fix) and automatically generate a detailed plan to start development.\n        >\n        > Let's get started!\"\n\n---\n\n## 2.0 PHASE 1: STREAMLINED PROJECT SETUP\n**PROTOCOL: Follow this sequence to perform a guided, interactive setup with the user.**\n\n\n### 2.0 Project Inception\n1.  **Detect Project Maturity:**\n    -   **Classify Project:** Determine if the project is \"Brownfield\" (Existing) or \"Greenfield\" (New) based on the following indicators:\n    -   **Brownfield Indicators:**\n        -   Check for existence of version control directories: `.git`, `.svn`, or `.hg`.\n        -   If a `.git` directory exists, execute `git status --porcelain`. If the output is not empty, classify as \"Brownfield\" (dirty repository).\n        -   Check for dependency manifests: `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`.\n        -   Check for source code directories: `src/`, `app/`, `lib/` containing code files.\n        -   If ANY of the above conditions are met (version control directory, dirty git repo, dependency manifest, or source code directories), classify as **Brownfield**.\n    -   **Greenfield Condition:**\n        -   Classify as **Greenfield** ONLY if NONE of the \"Brownfield Indicators\" are found AND the current directory is empty or contains only generic documentation (e.g., a single `README.md` file) without functional code or dependencies.\n\n2.  **Execute Workflow based on Maturity:**\n-   **If Brownfield:**\n        -   Announce that an existing project has been detected.\n        -   If the `git status --porcelain` command (executed as part of Brownfield Indicators) indicated uncommitted changes, inform the user: \"WARNING: You have uncommitted changes in your Git repository. Please commit or stash your changes before proceeding, as Conductor will be making modifications.\"\n        -   **Begin Brownfield Project Initialization Protocol:**\n            -   **1.0 Pre-analysis (Auto-Proceed):**\n                1.  **Announce:** Inform the user: \"I detected an existing project. I'll perform a read-only analysis to understand its structure.\"\n                2.  **Proceed directly** to code analysis. Since this is read-only, no permission is needed.\n\n            -   **2.0 Code Analysis:**\n                1.  **Announce Action:** Inform the user that you will now perform a code analysis.\n                2.  **Prioritize README:** Begin by analyzing the `README.md` file, if it exists.\n                3.  **Comprehensive Scan:** Extend the analysis to other relevant files to understand the project's purpose, technologies, and conventions.\n\n            -   **2.1 File Size and Relevance Triage:**\n                1.  **Respect Ignore Files:** Before scanning any files, you MUST check for the existence of `.geminiignore` and `.gitignore` files. If either or both exist, you MUST use their combined patterns to exclude files and directories from your analysis. The patterns in `.geminiignore` should take precedence over `.gitignore` if there are conflicts. This is the primary mechanism for avoiding token-heavy, irrelevant files like `node_modules`.\n                2.  **Efficiently List Relevant Files:** To list the files for analysis, you MUST use a command that respects the ignore files. For example, you can use `git ls-files --exclude-standard -co | xargs -n 1 dirname | sort -u` which lists all relevant directories (tracked by Git, plus other non-ignored files) without listing every single file. If Git is not used, you must construct a `find` command that reads the ignore files and prunes the corresponding paths.\n                3.  **Fallback to Manual Ignores:** ONLY if neither `.geminiignore` nor `.gitignore` exist, you should fall back to manually ignoring common directories. Example command: `ls -lR -I 'node_modules' -I '.m2' -I 'build' -I 'dist' -I 'bin' -I 'target' -I '.git' -I '.idea' -I '.vscode'`.\n                4.  **Prioritize Key Files:** From the filtered list of files, focus your analysis on high-value, low-size files first, such as `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, and other configuration or manifest files.\n                5.  **Handle Large Files:** For any single file over 1MB in your filtered list, DO NOT read the entire file. Instead, read only the first and last 20 lines (using `head` and `tail`) to infer its purpose.\n\n            -   **2.2 Extract and Infer Project Context:**\n                1.  **Strict File Access:** DO NOT ask for more files. Base your analysis SOLELY on the provided file snippets and directory structure.\n                2.  **Extract Tech Stack:** Analyze the provided content of manifest files to identify:\n                    -   Programming Language\n                    -   Frameworks (frontend and backend)\n                    -   Database Drivers\n                3.  **Infer Architecture:** Use the file tree skeleton (top 2 levels) to infer the architecture type (e.g., Monorepo, Microservices, MVC).\n                4.  **Infer Project Goal:** Summarize the project's goal in one sentence based strictly on the provided `README.md` header or `package.json` description.\n        -   **Upon completing the brownfield initialization protocol, proceed to the Generate Product Guide section in 2.1.**\n    -   **If Greenfield:**\n        -   Announce that a new project will be initialized.\n        -   Proceed to the next step in this file.\n\n3.  **Initialize Git Repository (for Greenfield):**\n    -   If a `.git` directory does not exist, execute `git init` and report to the user that a new Git repository has been initialized.\n\n4.  **Inquire about Project Goal (for Greenfield):**\n    -   **Use the `question` tool to ask the user:**\n        - header: \"Goal\"\n        - question: \"What do you want to build?\"\n        - options: [] (free text input)\n    -   **CRITICAL: You MUST NOT execute any tool calls until the user has provided a response.**\n    -   **Upon receiving the user's response:**\n        -   Execute `mkdir -p conductor`.\n        -   **Initialize State File:** Immediately after creating the `conductor` directory, you MUST create `conductor/setup_state.json` with the exact content:\n            `{\"last_successful_step\": \"\"}`\n        -   Write the user's response into `conductor/product.md` under a header named `# Initial Concept`.\n\n5.  **Continue:** Immediately proceed to the next section.\n\n### 2.1 Generate Product Guide (Interactive)\n1.  **Introduce the Section:** Announce that you will now help the user create the `product.md`.\n2.  **Ask Questions Sequentially:** Ask one question at a time using the `question` tool.

Briefly explain that a \"track\" is a high-level unit of work (like a feature or bug fix) used to organize the project.\n2.  **Generate Track Title:** Analyze the project context (`product.md`, `tech-stack.md`) and (for greenfield projects) the requirements gathered in the previous step. Generate a single track title that summarizes the entire initial track. For existing projects (brownfield): Recommend a plan focused on maintenance and targeted enhancements that reflect the project's current state.\n    - Greenfield project example (usually MVP):\n        ```markdown\n        To create the MVP of this project, I suggest the following track:\n        - Build the core functionality for the tip calculator with a basic calculator and built-in tip percentages.\n        ```\n    - Brownfield project example:\n        ```markdown\n        To create the first track of this project, I suggest the following track:\n        - Create user authentication flow for user sign in.\n        ```\n3.  **User Confirmation:** Present the generated track title to the user, then use the `question` tool:\n    - header: \"Track\"\n    - question: \"I propose starting with this track: '[track title]'. Does this look good?\"\n    - options: [{label: \"Yes, create this track\"}, {label: \"No, I want a different track\"}]\n    If the user declines, ask for clarification on what track to start with.\n\n### 3.3 Convert the Initial Track into Artifacts (Automated)\n1.  **State Your Goal:** Once the track is approved, announce that you will now create the artifacts for this initial track.\n\n2.  **Gather Implementation Preferences:**\n    Before creating artifacts, ask the user about their implementation preferences using the `question` tool. These will enable autonomous execution during `/conductor:implement`.\n    \n    **Ask THREE sequential questions** (one at a time, wait for response before next):\n    \n    **Question 1:** Use the `question` tool:\n    - header: \"On Failure\"\n    - question: \"If a task fails after 3 automatic fix attempts, how should I proceed?\"\n    - options: [{label: \"Skip and continue (report at end)\"}, {label: \"Stop and ask for help\"}]\n    \n    **Question 2:** Use the `question` tool:\n    - header: \"Doc Sync\"\n    - question: \"How should documentation updates be handled?\"\n    - options: [{label: \"Apply automatically\"}, {label: \"Skip (I'll handle manually)\"}]\n    \n    **Question 3:** Use the `question` tool:\n    - header: \"Cleanup\"\n    - question: \"When track completes, what to do with track folder?\"\n    - options: [{label: \"Archive automatically\"}, {label: \"Delete automatically\"}, {label: \"Keep as-is\"}]\n    \n    Parse the responses and map to preference values:\n    - Question 1: \"Skip and continue\" = \"skip_and_report\", \"Stop\" = \"stop_and_ask\"\n    - Question 2: \"Apply automatically\" = \"auto\", \"Skip\" = \"skip\"\n    - Question 3: \"Archive\" = \"archive\", \"Delete\" = \"delete\", \"Keep\" = \"keep\"\n\n3.  **Initialize Tracks File:** Create the `conductor/tracks.md` file with the initial header and the first track:\n    ```markdown\n    # Project Tracks\n\n    This file tracks all major tracks for the project. Each track has its own detailed plan in its respective folder.\n\n    ---\n\n    - [ ] **Track: <Track Description>**\n      *Link: [./conductor/tracks/<track_id>/](./conductor/tracks/<track_id>/)*\n    ```\n3.  **Generate Track Artifacts:**\n    a. **Define Track:** The approved title is the track description.\n    b. **Generate Track-Specific Spec & Plan:**\n        i. Automatically generate a detailed `spec.md` for this track.\n        ii. Automatically generate a `plan.md` for this track.\n            - **CRITICAL:** The structure of the tasks must adhere to the principles outlined in the workflow file at `conductor/workflow.md`. For example, if the workflow specificies Test-Driven Development, each feature task must be broken down into a \"Write Tests\" sub-task followed by an \"Implement Feature\" sub-task.\n            - **CRITICAL:** Include status markers `[ ]` for **EVERY** task and sub-task. The format must be:\n                - Parent Task: `- [ ] Task: ...`\n                - Sub-task: `    - [ ] ...`\n            - **CRITICAL: Inject Phase Completion Tasks.** You MUST read the `conductor/workflow.md` file to determine if a \"Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol\" is defined. If this protocol exists, then for each **Phase** that you generate in `plan.md`, you MUST append a final meta-task to that phase. The format for this meta-task is: `- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification '<Phase Name>' (Protocol in workflow.md)`. You MUST replace `<Phase Name>` with the actual name of the phase.\n    c. **Create Track Artifacts:**\n        i. **Generate and Store Track ID:** Create a unique Track ID from the track description using format `shortname_YYYYMMDD` and store it. You MUST use this exact same ID for all subsequent steps for this track.\n        ii. **Create Single Directory:** Using the stored Track ID, create a single new directory: `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/`.\n        iii. **Create `metadata.json`:** In the new directory, create a `metadata.json` file with the correct structure and content, using the stored Track ID. The file MUST include the preferences gathered in step 2. An example is:\n            - ```json\n            {\n            \"track_id\": \"<track_id>\",\n            \"type\": \"feature\",\n            \"status\": \"new\",\n            \"created_at\": \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\",\n            \"description\": \"<Initial user description>\",\n            \"preferences\": {\n              \"on_failure\": \"skip_and_report\",\n              \"doc_sync\": \"auto\",\n              \"cleanup\": \"archive\"\n            }\n            }\n            ```\n        Populate fields with actual values including the user's preference choices. Use the current timestamp.\n        iv. **Write Spec and Plan Files:** In the exact same directory, write the generated `spec.md` and `plan.md` files.\n\n    d. **Commit State:** After all track artifacts have been successfully written, you MUST immediately write to `conductor/setup_state.json` with the exact content:\n       `{\"last_successful_step\": \"3.3_initial_track_generated\"}`\n\n    e. **Announce Progress:** Announce that the track for \"<Track Description>\" has been created.\n\n### 3.4 Final Announcement\n1.  **Announce Completion:** After the track has been created, announce that the project setup and initial track generation are complete.\n2.  **Report Agent Interactions:** Include the total count of agent interactions during setup: `Agent Interactions: X total`\n3.  **Save Conductor Files:** Add and commit all files with the commit message `conductor(setup): Add conductor setup files`.\n4.  **Next Steps:** Inform the user that they can now begin work by running `/conductor:implement`.\n"
